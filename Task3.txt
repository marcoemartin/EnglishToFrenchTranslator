MLE (delta =0) was the one that took the longest. As the Delta was increased
the preplexity increases logarithmically. This is due to the fact that add-one smoothing is 
allocating probability for some seen vs unseen events. Therefore, as delta increases the more
probabiltiy mass of unseen events is collected, which cuases more bias and more preplexity.
Addtionally, the French value is slightly higher for most of the deltas. This may be due 
to the less strict way we parse french and to the the fact that French has more complex 
conjugations than Enlish making it more complex to parse.
